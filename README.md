# A-Brief-Inquiry-Into-Supervised-Learning-In-Skin-Cancer-Asymmetry-ROI-And-KNN-Classification
This study presents the development of a machine  learning model for the classification of skin lesions using the  HAM10000 dataset.
To run this codes, you need to download the Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000/data.

Replace the respective files and folders routes with the location in your device.

You can use the steps mentioned in the paper to run this codes.

Visualization codes are mean only for visualization, and extraction codes only for extraction.

The only codes that should be run in a specific order are the ones of the Region Of Interest, running ROIVisualizationAndExtraction first and then ROIExtraction, and the ones of Assymetry, running AssymetryExtraction first and then AssymetryMean.
